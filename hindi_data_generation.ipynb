    "# Data Generation\n",
    "### Contributed by Praveen Yadav, [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/fnc11/nball4treehindi)\n",
    "In this part, we already had two input files, the tree structure or paths for all nodes to the topmost parent and a file which had the set to word mapping which we printed from the modernSyn2Words dictionary in the pre-processing section.\n",
    "So the first thing we did, we made two dictionaries out of the set to word mapping, one from set to word and another is the reverse, so by doing this we kind of ignored all other words in a set, kept only the first one in the list, because that was the easiest way to handle this data.\n",
    "We formed a Tree class with standard attributes and methods which you’ll understand once you go through the implementation of that and some extra methods which we needed for later experiments also.\n",
    "Now before we start building the tree from the paths we once again passed all the sets through our newly formed dictionary set to word to make sure there should not be any set number in the tree nodes for which we don’t have a corresponding set. After this filtering, we started building the tree, now we made *root* as the ultimate parent of each node. While making the tree we tried to store the set numbers in the nodes, further details can be found in the implementation.\n",
    "Now the stage was set to just print out the files we needed for experiment 1, used some simple code to print out the data in the required format, wordSenseChildren was simple tree traversal while for printing category codes we needed to write some complicated code because we need to print the category codes for the intermediate nodes as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Difficulties/Choices:\n",
    "1. Taking only first word from the modernSyn2Words dictionary, ignoring all other words in the set.\n",
    "2. While making the tree we stored the reference to all the node objects in a dictionary for faster access, to attach the child nodes directly and this dictionary was also used in later experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run the below code\n",
    "### To generate the tree out of the paths and also generate the wordSenseChildren.txt and catCodes.txt file which we ultimately need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tree Class\n",
    "* a utility class that we need for building the tree from our data."
